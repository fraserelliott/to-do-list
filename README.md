# to-do-list

As part of a bootcamp in full stack development, I was tasked with making a to-do list app. I decided to push myself and add a lot more features to this. The full feature list:
- Add/Delete/Edit/Complete tasks. You can't have duplicate tasks.
- History tab showing what has previously been deleted. You can either move these back to the tasks or permanently delete them.
- A button to clear all completed tasks.
- Dark mode button.
- Settings to clear all data, automatically delete tasks on completion and to hide duplicate tasks in the history tab.
- Custom alert popup for any errors.
- Data saving in local storage.
